# How to Find Your EmailJS Template ID

## Step 1: Go to EmailJS Templates
1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/template
2. You should see a list of your templates

## Step 2: Find Your Contact Us Template
1. Look for the "Contact Us" template
2. Click on it to open it

## Step 3: Find the Template ID
The Template ID is usually shown in one of these places:
- In the URL: `https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/template/XXXXX` (the XXXXX is your template ID)
- In the template settings/details page
- It might be shown as "Template ID" or "ID" somewhere on the page

The Template ID will look like: `template_xxxxxxx` (starts with "template_")

## Step 4: Share the Template ID
Once you find it, share it with me and I'll update the code.

## Alternative: Create a New Template
If you can't find the template ID, you can create a new template:
1. Click "Create New Template"
2. Name it "Contact Form Notification"
3. Set it up with the content we discussed
4. Copy the new Template ID
5. Share it with me to update the code
